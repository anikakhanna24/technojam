About Myself:I am Anika Khanna and I belong to the city of Kanpur,Uttar Pradesh.I am pursuing B.Tech CSE from Galgotias University at present.I am enthusiastic about my new journey as a computer science student 
             and desperately  want to be a part of such a community of coders and developers.
Approach: *Learned HTML from youtube 
          *I am really fascinated by archeological things so i decided to make a website showcasing India's historic artifacts 
             and did a research on the same.
Challenges faced: It was challenging enough as I had never touched this "Web development" thing before and honestly did not know from where to start.It took me time to understand what all is required to develop
a website and concluded that it requires mainly three things HTML,CSS and JavaScript. Alongside assignments and lab files it was difficult to learn all the three but i still managed to learn html and make not so fancy 
but a simple website.I also had no knowledge of how to use github but now I can understand some of the basic features and hope will have a good command over it in future.
